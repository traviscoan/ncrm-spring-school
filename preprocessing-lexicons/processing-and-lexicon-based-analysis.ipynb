    "\n",
    "1. Introducing Python via a real-world text analysis task.\n",
    "2. Illustrating how to load data into (and write data out of) Python\n",
    "3. Learning to implement \"standard\" text pre-processing in Python\n",
    "4. Learning how to conduct a lexicon-based sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these objectives, we will focus on a dataset which contains all of Donald Trump's tweets for the year 2017. Our challenge is to build a simple lexicon (or dictionary) to track negative sentiment in Trump's Twitter feed. Let's get started!\n",

    "This notebook offers an introduction to progamming in the Python language. It's impossible to cover it all in a single notebook (or a single class!); however, this notebook highlights core aspects of Python that are important for this class. I highly recommend the (free and online!) book <a href=https://python.swaroopch.com/><i>A Byte of Python</i></a> if you would like to further study the ideas outlined in this notebook."
